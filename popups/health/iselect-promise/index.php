   <h1>The iSelect Price Promise for Health Insurance</h1> 
   <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2> 
   <p><strong>"iSelect"</strong>, <strong>"we"</strong> or <strong>"us"</strong> refers to iSelect Ltd and its subsidiaries.</p> 
   <p><strong>"You"</strong> refers to you, the customer.</p> 
   <h2>Overview</h2> 
   <p> At iSelect we pride ourselves on helping you find a health insurance policy that meets your needs from our <a href="http://iselect.com.au/iselect-core/v5/popups/health/iselect_approved_product_list.jsp" title="Approved Product List">Approved Product List</a>. We back this confidence in relation to health insurance policies sold through us, with the iSelect Price Promise described in these Terms and Conditions. </p> 
   <p> Under the <strong>iSelect Price Promise</strong> we promise that - if you purchase a health insurance policy through us and then happen to find a cheaper price (with respect to annual premiums) on an identical health insurance policy from the same fund within the 30 days after the relevant date of purchase through iSelect - we will make it up to you by sending you a Coles Group &amp; Myer Gift Card or other gift card determined by us ("<strong>Gift Card</strong>"). If you are eligible for the benefit of the iSelect Price Promise, the Gift Card we provide you will be to the value of <strong>200%</strong> of the difference in the price of the premiums between the two identical health insurance policies you have shown us for the first year of your policy purchased through iSelect ("the <strong>Price Difference</strong>"). </p> 
   <p> Please note that in order to be eligible, the cheaper premium that you find for the relevant health insurance policy must be standard pricing offered by the fund and must be pricing generally available to the public. </p> 
   <h2>Claiming the iSelect Price Promise</h2> 
   <p> To claim the benefit of the iSelect Price Promise you must, within 30 days of purchasing your health insurance policy through iSelect, notify us of your requested claim and send us your name, contact details, iSelect client ID and documented confirmation of the cheaper health insurance policy quote on letterhead paper or other documentation which clearly identifies the price offered and the relevant fund. (For example, you could print out the fund webpage at the final payment stage for the cheaper policy you have found.) You must also provide us details of the relevant policy description, policy terms and condition, and the date of the cheaper quote clearly shown. You must send this claim notification and information via email to <a href="mailto:customerexperience@iselect.com.au" title="customerexperience@iselect.com.au">customerexperience@iselect.com.au</a> or via post to iSelect Ltd, 294 Bay Rd, Cheltehham VIC 3192. If we are reasonably satisfied that the policy you have purchased through iSelect and the cheaper identical policy you have identified are eligible for the iSelect Price Promise in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, we will send you a Gift Card for 200% of the relevant Price Difference. </p> 
   <p> Your claim for the iSelect Price Promise must also comply with the further detailed Terms and Conditions below. Any Gift Cards issued by us under the iSelect Price Promise will be in accordance with these Terms and Conditions (including the further detailed Terms and Conditions below), </p> 
   <h2>Further Detail and Eligibility Criteria</h2> 
   <ol type="decimal"> 
    <li> To be eligible for the benefit of the iSelect Price Promise, you must: 
     <ol type="a"> 
      <li>be an Australian resident aged 18 years and over;</li> 
      <li>within 30 days of purchasing your health insurance policy through iSelect, find an identical health insurance policy from the same fund for a lower price with respect to annual premiums payable; and</li> 
      <li>hold your health insurance policy purchased through iSelect for at least 30 days; and</li> 
     </ol> </li> 
    <li>The iSelect Price Promise applies only to health insurance policies sold through iSelect. It does not apply to any other products or policies sold through iSelect (e.g. life insurance, electricity).</li> 
    <li> For the cheaper health insurance policy to be "identical" to the health insurance policy purchased through iSelect and therefore eligible for the benefit of the iSelect Price Promise, the cheaper policy must be the same in every respect to the health insurance policy you purchased through us (including policy type, level of cover, any extras included, excess chosen, and any applicable Australian Government Rebate on Private Health Insurance and Lifetime Health Cover applied). The policy must also be sold by the same health insurance fund. </li> 
    <li> After receiving your claim notification and pricing and product information from you, we will endeavour to advise you in writing that, either: 
     <ol type="a"> 
      <li>you are eligible for the iSelect Price Promise and that we will be sending you a Gift Card when we can for 200% of the relevant Price Difference between the two; or</li> 
      <li> you are not entitled to the benefit of the iSelect Price Promise. Reasons for your non-entitlement to the iSelect Price Promise may include: we were unable to confirm the validity or accuracy of the cheaper quote you provided; we considered that the cheaper quote found by you was not identical to the health insurance policy sold to you through iSelect (or it was not from the same fund). We do not guarantee that we will provide reasons if we decide that you are not entitled to the iSelect Price Promise. </li> 
     </ol> </li> 
    <li> The iSelect Price Promise (and the benefits offered under the iSelect Price Promise): 
     <ol type="a"> 
      <li>only applies to the policy premium of the relevant health insurance policy, and does not include other gifts, offers, promotions or incentives provided in conjunction with the policy;</li> 
      <li>does not apply to Overseas Visitors Cover or corporate offers or discounts offered by funds or providers in relation to health insurance policies also sold through iSelect;</li> 
      <li>is not transferable to any other person or redeemable for cash; and</li> 
      <li>can only be claimed once per health insurance policy purchased through us.</li> 
     </ol> </li> 
    <li>The value of any Gift Card issued for 200% of the relevant Price Difference may be rounded up to the nearest $5.00.</li> 
    <li> Any Gift Card issued may take up to 60 days to be issued and will be sent via registered post to the postal address you have nominated to us. If you lose the Gift Card, no replacement Gift Card will be issued to you. </li> 
    <li>iSelect is not responsible for any delay in delivery or non-delivery of a Gift Card due to incorrect details or information being submitted by or on behalf a customer to us.</li> 
    <li> Use of any Gift Card issued under the iSelect Price Promise is subject to the Coles Group &amp; Myer Gift Card Terms of Use (or the terms of use of other relevant Gift Card providers if we use any other Gift Cards in fulfilling the iSelect Price Promise). To view the Coles Group &amp; Myer Gift Card Terms of Use, visit giftcards.com.au or phone 1300 304 990. </li>
